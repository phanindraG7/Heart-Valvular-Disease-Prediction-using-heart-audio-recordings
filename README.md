# Heart-Valvular-Disease-Prediction-using-heart-audio-recordings
This repository contains a machine learning and deep learning project focused on predicting heart valvular disease using digital stethoscope recordings. The project involves advanced techniques for feature extraction and model development to enhance the accuracy of the predictions.

The project titled **Heart Valvular Disease Prediction using digital stethoscope recordings**. In this project, I performed feature extraction for audio data using advanced techniques like MFCC, DWT, and CWT. I further combined these methods to create hybrid models such as MFCC+DWT, MFCC+CWT+DWT, and MFCC+DWT+CWT. The extracted features were then used to classify the data using various machine learning and deep learning algorithms, including Gradient Boosting, KNN, ANN, and LSTM. I compared the performance of these algorithms to determine the most effective approach for accurate predictions. Below is a graph representing the accuracies of all the models.
